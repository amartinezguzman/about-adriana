<h1>Hi! My Name is Adriana.</h1>
<ul>
    <li>I live in Albuquerque but grew up in Phoenix, AZ.</li>
    <li><span style="color: Red;">Yes it's <strong> VERY HOT!</strong></span> <span style="color: lightpink;">(Not as hot as Zac Efron's new face, but still.. HOT)</span></li>
    <li>I have a cat that I found while working at a non-profit.  I've named him "501c3" until I can think of a better one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I love doing outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, climbing, swimming and kayaking. I also enjoy indoor activities such as library yodeling, and thumb wrestling political candidates.</li>
    <li>One of my favorite hobbies is social dancing. That's where you boogie down at least six feet away from your partner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recent Accomplishment</h3>
